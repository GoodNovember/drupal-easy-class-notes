  Image Styles are often used as a minumum style.
    Different image styles can be used when viewing a the same image in various contexts

Text Formats:
  Whatever a user types in, it gets stored as is in drupal's database. User input is sacred, it will not modify input.

  Text formats allow us to filter user entered data when it is displayed.

  If it says "Formatted" we can apply text formatters

Media Entities (fieldable)
  Images
  Videos
  Files
  Audio
  Twitter, Insta, etc. (Via contrib mods)

Image Style types allow us to have images modified in a set ordered way: like rotate, crop, scale, desaturate, et al. these actions are prerformed on demand and each view can have a specified collection of formats.

Text Format filters can do things like validate html, remove cursing, auto link email addresses, etc.

Use the Insert module to allow for more robust media insertion into body junk
