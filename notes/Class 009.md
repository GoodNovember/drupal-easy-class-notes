Did not take notes durring class, but it was rather straight forward.

Block Group Visibility is pretty neat, and D8 has altered the Reuse Existing Fields behaviour to mean that you can
only reuse the fields that exist in other entity types of the same type. This means that a fielded block cannot re-use
fields of a content-type and vice versa. 

Personally, I still feel that the reuse fields thing is a feature waiting to be removed.

Anyway. Next class we are to talk about the Paragraphs Module, which is exciting.
